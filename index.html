The Royal Hospital and Collegiate Church of St. Katharine by the Tower.\nThis was a medieval church and hospital founded by Queen Matilda of Boulogne, wife of King Stephen. From 1273 onwards patronage was always held by the queen.  By the nineteenth century it had grown to a village providing refuge to immigrants and to the poor. Considered insanitary and located close to the City this was the site chosen for new docks. This happened during a period that there was no queen available to be patron and so, unprotected,'old Kate' was demolished.The last service in the church took place on the 30th October 1825, with construction starting in 1827, the foundation stone being laid in May of that year.","The Grade II listed Dock Master’s Office, with the curved frontage onto the river, still has a prominent position to the right of the dock entrance. The early 19th century was a time of considerable expansion of the docks, eastward from the City. The volume of shipping and of goods was high, and the charges levied by the dock owners had limited competition, so there was no incentive to reduce charges.The docks were completed and officially opened on the 25th October 1828.The docks were bombed during the war, and never recovered after the war, becoming the first of the London docks to close, in 1968.","But why the elephants? When used as a trading dock, St Katharine’s dealt mainly in tea and ivory. The elephants are a reminder of the docks’ former trading days. They were mounted on the original vermiculated gatepiers in 1973 to commemorate the heritage of the trading dock.","4","5","6","7"];
